			My love of photography started in the1970s with my first SLR, an Olympus OM2, and focused exclusively on black and white photography.  I spent some time in the mid seventies also working wth a Cambo 4x5 large format camera.  I studied photography with some great instructors at The Center for Photographic Studies, Glen Echo, and The Corcoran School of Art.  With the lack of a darkroom in the eighties and nineties, I drifted away from photography and focused on my career in database technologies.  With the advent of digital photography in the early 2000s, my passion for photography resurfaced as I was able to process my photos at home.  <br><br>

			As you can probably tell from viewing my photos, my photographic experience is a solitary and meditative process.  There are rarely any people or animals in my photos.  I enjoy experiencing the mood invoked by light and texture, and the passage of time.  I employ alternative methods and tools in my process, as my desire is not necessarily to acurately reproduce a subject but to reproduce the feeling behind it.<br><br>

			My photography is mostly a cathartic experience, but I hope that I have been able to share some of that experience through my photos.

Thank you for taking the time to peruse my work.
